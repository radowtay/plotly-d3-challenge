# plotly-d3-challenge

Hello!

While my site is not fully functional yet, please find two challenging Plotly visualizations: a bar chart, and a bubble chart.  The dropdown menu is populated, but does not accurately update the Plotly visualizations.  The Demographics area is populated, but does not accurately pull data.   

I will be improving this file as these things begin to make more sense!  This was quite the challenge!
